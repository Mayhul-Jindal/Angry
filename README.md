# Angry

This was my first ever project which I made using python. Aim to make this project was to learn about various networking protocols, how does client serer communication works and some very basic malwares.

# Features

- `Stream music` like discord. Search the song on the cli and you will get top 3 searches from the youtube. Then select the song you want to play.
- A service to `ddos` a particular website. You can `dynamically change your mac and ip address` which make it difficult to track you but obv you can be tracked lol :)
- Get a script to `extract wifi passwords and chrome/firefox saved credentials` which is then emailed to the provided gmail id.

> Note: This is a very old project of mine so there is a possibility that there will be bugs here and there. Never the less I just learned a lot and want to upload this proj on my github
